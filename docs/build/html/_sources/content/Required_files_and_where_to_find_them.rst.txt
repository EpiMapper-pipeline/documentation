=======================================
Required Files and Where to Find Them
=======================================

When using this Python Package, you need to provide different reference files, which you may not know where to find. Therefore, we made this simple overveiw to make it easier for you to locate and download all the necessary files to run the full pipeline.
If you are just using some of the functions, please check what files you need to provide in the documentation of the various functions, as you may not have to download them all. 

The EpiMapper flowthrough as shown in the figure below. Here, the different functions are represented by blue squares and their output represented by pink shapes. Files that must be provided by the user is represented by green shapes, below is a short decription of these files.

**Bowtie2 index files**

As mentioned in the bowtie2_alignment documentation page, you may either supply the index files directly or you may provide a FASTA file of your reference genome.

The `Bowtie2 website <https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml>`_ do actually conatin a lot of pre-made index files for download. Using these may cut the analysis time, as the bowtie2_alignment does not have to create indexing files itself. 
While these may be a quick solution, it is important to consider the requirement of every experiment (i.e, which parts of the genome should be considered). 

FASTA files of refernce genomes may easily be found and downloaded from `NCBIÂ´s website <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_. Again, it is essential to check what is included in the reference genome file, as some may include ChrUn or unknown clone contigs that cannot be confidently placed on a specific chromosome.
These contigs are usually removed before further analysis as they do not tell us a whole lot and may actually interfere with the analysis, much like the next required file: genome blacklist. 

**Genome Blacklist BED File**

A genome blacklist contrains regions of the genome that should be avioded in further analysis. The reason some areas are removed may differ, but some of the causes may be that the region is highly repetative, leading to false signals, the region is highly condensed or simply not of interest for the study.
If you would like to leave out whole chromosomes it is possible to simply include the chromosomes in the geneome blacklist.
The file format needed is BED, only containing [chromosome  start  end] in tab-separated columns. 
These BED files may be downloaded from `UCSC Website <https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html>`_  or the ENCODE blacklists may be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/Boyle-Lab/Blacklist>`_ , depending on the reference genome. 
Here, it is important to remember that the blacklist file must be sorted before using it as input for the EpiMapper pipeline.  If you have downloaded from the ENCODE GitHub you may sort the file by running this command:

.. code-block:: bash 

    $ sort -k1,1V -k2,2n -k3,3n YOUR_FILE.bed | cut -f1-3 > YOUR_FILE_SORTED.bed


**Chromosome Sizes**

A text (.txt) file containing chromosome names and their respective sizes in base pairs must be supplied to utilize the EpiMapper. Here, the two columns must be tab-separated.
Here is an example for Rn6:

.. code-block:: bash 

    chr1	282763074
    chr2	266435125
    chr3	177699992
    chr4	184226339
    chr5	173707219
    chr6	147991367
    chr7	145729302
    chr8	133307652
    chr9	122095297
    chr10	112626471
    chr11	90463843
    chr12	52716770
    chr13	114033958
    chr14	115493446
    chr15	111246239
    chr16	90668790
    chr17	90843779
    chr18	88201929
    chr19	62275575
    chr20	56205956
    chrX	159970021
    chrY	3310458

Chromosome size files are avalible for download at the `UCSC website <https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html>`_. However, as mentioned, these files may contain random chromosomes for example chr4_gl000194_random.
These "random" molecules must be removed before utilzing the file. This may be done quite easily manually by simply opening the file in a text editor and removing all the "random" chromosomes. After that the file should be sorted, which is quicly done by:

.. code-block:: bash 

    $ sort -k1,1 YOUR_FILE.txt > YOUR_FILE_SORTED.txt


**RefFlat Reference Text File**

The last file you will need is a RefFlat text file containing information about where genes are located in your reference genome. These files may also be found at  `UCSC website <https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html>`_. 
This file will serve as a reference for annotation as well as the creation of heatmaps.


**Optinal: Enchancher**

If you are intrested in annotation your peaks to enhancer regions, a seperate enhancer reference BED file must be supplied. Enchancer files may be found at `EnchancerAtlas 2.0 <http://www.enhanceratlas.org/index.php>`_.
However,these files must be processed to have this format:

.. code-block:: bash

    chr1	50218	50564	chr1:50218:50564||enhancer:2||346
    chr1	111057	111395	chr1:111057:111395||enhancer:1||338
    chr1	173031	174331	chr1:173031:174331||enhancer:3||1300
    chr1	174502	176296	chr1:174502:176296||enhancer:6||1794
    chr1	176997	177953	chr1:176997:177953||enhancer:1||956
    chr1	178015	178611	chr1:178015:178611||enhancer:1||596
    chr1	180133	180455	chr1:180133:180455||enhancer:1||322
    chr1	180586	180859	chr1:180586:180859||enhancer:1||273


How you achive this format will depend on your starting file, however below is a simple python code for creating this format based on hg19 pancreas from `EnchancerAtlas 2.0 <http://www.enhanceratlas.org/index.php>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    import pandas as pd

    bed_file = '/Users/me/documents/Pancreas.bed'

    bed_df = pd.read_csv(bed_file,header=None, sep="\t", names= ['chr','start','end','remove'])

    bed_out = bed_df[['chr','start','end']].copy()

    bed_out['id'] = bed_out.apply(lambda row: f"{row['chr']}:{row['start']}:{row['end']}||enhancer||{row['end'] - row['start']}", axis=1)

    bed_out.to_csv(bed_file.replace('.bed','_converted.bed'), header=None, sep='\t', index=False)
